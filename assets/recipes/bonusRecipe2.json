Once they have cooked for 25 minutes, put them through a Foley Food Mill, which takes no time at all and eliminates using a modern appliance. (Who couldn't use a little upper arm twirls?) The recipe is excellent and is my new go-to applesauce recipe. If you noticed, this recipe actually makes 6-7 PINTS, not cups of applesauce. I also used extra sugar - about another 1/2 cup.",
